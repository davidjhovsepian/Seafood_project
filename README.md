### **Project Overview:**

As a **Project Manager** overseeing the **ECC to S/4HANA transformation** for Pacific Seafood's subsidiaries, including those in California and potentially San Diego, my role was critical in modernizing the company's IT infrastructure. The transformation aimed to streamline operations, enhance process efficiencies, and enable real-time analytics across the organization's vast supply chain, helping to future-proof Pacific Seafood’s competitive edge in a highly regulated industry.

### **Key Responsibilities:**

1.  **Strategic Planning and Alignment:**
    
    *   **Project Scoping:** I led efforts to define the project’s scope, identifying which business units and subsidiaries would undergo the transition to S/4HANA. Specific modules, including finance, procurement, and supply chain, were prioritized for early migration.
    *   **Stakeholder Engagement:** Regular collaboration with C-suite executives, IT leadership, and department heads across subsidiaries ensured that our project goals aligned with Pacific Seafood’s broader strategic objectives.
    *   **Risk Assessment:** My team conducted in-depth risk analysis to anticipate potential supply chain disruptions and data integrity risks during the migration, setting proactive mitigation strategies in place.
2.  **Team Leadership and Coordination:**
    
    *   **Cross-Functional Leadership:** I led a multidisciplinary team, composed of IT professionals, SAP consultants, and representatives from finance, operations, and procurement, ensuring diverse input and comprehensive solutions.
    *   **Subsidiary Coordination:** Ensuring that local business needs, especially those of the California and San Diego subsidiaries, were integrated into the transformation was crucial for success.
    *   **Training and Change Management:** I spearheaded employee training programs and a communication strategy that addressed change management, preparing teams for a smooth transition and driving user adoption of the new system.
3.  **Technical Oversight and Integration:**
    
    *   **System Landscape Assessment:** My technical oversight included evaluating the current ECC landscape, determining necessary customizations and adjustments for S/4HANA, and ensuring system integrations, including warehouse and logistics platforms, were correctly implemented.
    *   **Data Migration Strategy:** A critical focus was on designing and executing a data migration strategy that would securely and accurately transfer Pacific Seafood’s extensive inventory, supply chain, and financial data to the new system.
    *   **Third-Party Integrations:** Ensuring seamless integrations of legacy systems and third-party applications was essential for maintaining Pacific Seafood’s operational continuity across its supply chain.
4.  **Timeline and Budget Management:**
    
    *   **Project Timeline:** I developed a comprehensive project plan with phased milestones from blueprinting to go-live, ensuring all deadlines were met.
    *   **Budgeting and Resources:** Effective resource management allowed us to maintain the project within the allocated budget, with a focus on optimizing costs while ensuring quality delivery.
5.  **Testing and Quality Assurance:**
    
    *   **Testing Phases:** I directed all testing phases, from unit and integration testing to user acceptance testing (UAT), ensuring that subsidiaries were fully involved in validating system accuracy.
    *   **Error Resolution:** Coordinating with the technical team, I led the resolution of system bugs and data migration issues, ensuring a smooth go-live experience.
    *   **Compliance and Reporting:** Ensuring the system adhered to food safety and supply chain regulations was paramount, particularly for reporting accuracy in compliance audits.
6.  **Post-Go-Live Support:**
    
    *   **Hypercare Phase:** Following the go-live, I managed the hypercare phase, providing direct support to all Pacific Seafood subsidiaries, ensuring that any issues were promptly addressed.
    *   **Continuous Improvement:** Post-migration, I worked with IT teams to fine-tune processes and leverage the advanced capabilities of S/4HANA for ongoing business value.

### **Challenges and Considerations:**

1.  **Complex Operations:** Pacific Seafood's broad supply chain and its diverse subsidiaries required careful coordination to ensure the migration addressed the needs of each location without disrupting operations.
    
2.  **Data Integrity:** Maintaining data accuracy throughout the migration process, particularly for sensitive inventory and financial systems, was a top priority.
    
3.  **Change Management:** Managing employee resistance and ensuring smooth user adoption was a significant challenge, requiring well-coordinated training and clear communication.
    
4.  **Downtime and Risk Mitigation:** Ensuring minimal operational downtime was crucial, especially for time-sensitive seafood processing and distribution.
    

### **Success Metrics:**

*   **On-Time Delivery:** The migration was completed according to the established timeline.
*   **On-Budget Delivery:** The project stayed within the allocated budget.
*   **User Adoption:** Post-go-live surveys indicated high user adoption and satisfaction with the new system.
*   **Operational Efficiency:** Significant improvements were observed in process efficiencies and data reporting, leading to faster decision-making.
*   **Minimal Disruption:** The project successfully transitioned Pacific Seafood to S/4HANA with minimal impact on day-to-day operations.

This project significantly modernized Pacific Seafood's IT infrastructure, enabling the company to remain agile and competitive in a dynamic market.
